    <h1>Slow Cooker Carnitas</h1>

    <h2>Carnitas means 'little meats' and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and burritos. This filling is also great combined with your favorite barbecue sauce and served on buns.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crumbled dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 boneless pork shoulder roast (4lbs)</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. Coat pork with the spice mixture. Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat.</li>
    </ol>
